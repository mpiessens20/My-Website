        <h3>Website Update - 8/28/23</h3>
        <h4>
            Has been a busy, codeless month. I moved down to North Carolina again. Was pretty much fully
            settled within a week, but spent a lot of time getting used to the area, getting a routine,
            and figuring out life in the United States again. Have had a lot of fun running and reading.
            Nothing too exciting, but lifes good. Will be trying to work on the website more soon,
            especially once winter hits. It aint getting much better than this though. My next goal is
            to actually have content in all of the tabs.
        </h4>

        <h3>Website Update - 7/28/23</h3>
        <h4>
            Created an icon for the website for the first time. It's pretty basic, I used Krita to
            create it
            pixel by pixel. Took about 90 minutes. Now I am just messing with the formatting and trying
            to get
            text to work with for the website itself. It is hard to test layouts without content.

        <h3>Mount Lafayette Trail Loop - 7/27/23</h3>
        <div class="left">
            <img src="images/MtnSelfie.jpeg" />
            <h3>Near The Summit</h3>
        </div>
        <h4>Did a massive 8.6 mile hike with my friend Garafano up Mount Lafaytte. We decided we
            would go up into the white mountains without any plans and hike whatever random
            trail we pull into. Coincidentally chose one of the hardest ones.
            <a href=https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-hampshire/mount-lafayette-and-franconia-ridge-trail-loop>This
                is the trail</a> we hiked. Took about 5 hours. Actually wasn't too bad, but
            stepped in mud about halfway through and bruised my feet up a bit. Feet looked
            disgusting at the end.<br><br>

            Overall the hike was fun, but I have recently began to really lose interest in being
            in nature for the sake of it. I used to want to do massive hikes and make that my
            priority, but like all hobbies it eventually gets stale and kinda weird when you put
            too much focus on it.

        <h3>My Life - 7/26/23</h3>
        <h4>
            Went to Planet Fitness in the morning, nothing too interesting. After that I made some vegan
            mac n' cheese which actually was alright. Played cornhole with family next. Read some
            catechism.
