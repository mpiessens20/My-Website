        <h4>
            Over the span of my life, I have gone from atheist, to new age, to protestant, to Catholic. I have
            given a look at all the major philosophies and religions, oddly enough finding that the resurrection
            of Jesus Christ was the one thing I could not disprove.
        </h4>

        <h4>
            I struggled for years trying to find any real meaning in life. It’s always been beyond clear that pretty
            much everybody is distracting themselves until retirement and death. A warped or absent view of God lead me
            and many others down these unfulfilling paths. All religions and philosophies that offer answers lack
            authority and have no real proof or reason for adherence. Feeling empty after going through science,
            meditation, eastern religions, hobbies, and women, the last place I had to look was the Bible.
        </h4>

        <h4>
            After a year of deeply digging into the Bible, ancient texts, and history, I found myself in a position
            where it took more faith to be atheist than Christian. Deeper digging into the new testament and early
            church made clear that Christ used St. Peter as the foundation of his Church. Although it may be impossible
            for me to fully explain everything that steered me to Catholicism, I will do my best to help others to find
            joy in the faith.

            I will be adding more content to this tab and overall website over time, but for now
            <a href="https://faculty.som.yale.edu/jameschoi/whychrist/">this</a> greatly puts many of the factors
            that led me to Christianity.
