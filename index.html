            Whether you are a family member, friend, or random stranger on the internet, I hope you enjoy
            learning a little about myself. I’ll try and make it worth your time. On the above tabs you can find
            links to the most prominent pillars of my life at the moment. I hope I can use this website to help
            at least a few people.

        <blockquote class="italics ">
            A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and then put it
            under a bushel basket; it is set on a lampstand, where it gives light to all in the house.
            Just so, your light must shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify
            your heavenly Father.<br />

            Although I am 23 and have made tons of mistakes through my life, I have been spending the past few
            years doing everything possible to better myself and others. Despite my flaws, I hope I can inspire
            whoever is reading this in some way. If you would like to contact me, feel free to reach out using
            either my email or phone number at the bottom of the page.

            The actual content on this website is currently dog meat. I have the structure of the website pretty much
            finished (still need to improve layout of blog), so hopefully I can make the website interesting soon (typed
            9/4/2023). I want to make sure everything is placed correctly so I do not need to remake the whole website
            once it has stuff on it. Most text is currently filler I do not like.
