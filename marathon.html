        <h4>
            I am currently training to run a marathon in memory of Kostyantyn Semonov. I worked with Kostyantyn
            from 2021 to 2022, and over the course of that year I saw how he effortlessly lifted up everyone
            around
            him. One of the purest people I have known, he was so humble and kind despite being insanely
            intelligent and having a backstory that would have jaded or destroyed anybody else. I deeply enjoyed
            all of the hours long conversations I had with him and truly was happy whenever we were rambling
            together.
            He had a profound impact on me and truly changed my outlook on life.</h4>

        <h4>
            Kostyantyn suddenly died from cancer in January of 2023 at the age of 65. I was sadly not able to
            say goodbye, but feel obligated to honor him in some way. I have been training since February and
            will be running the marathon before June of next year.
        </h4>

        <h4>
            If you have a picture of Kostyatyn, please email it to me. I sadly never took one and would like to add it
            to this site.
