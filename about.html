        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4>
            In case you haven’t seen the website name, my name is Michael Piessens. I am a proud Catholic who is
            trying
            to make the most of this life with the time I got. I spend most of my time either outdoors or doing
            nerd
            stuff. I’m not going to say too much
            incase
            some weirdo somehow stumbles into this website.
        </h4>
        <h3>What Is On This Website</h3>
        <h4>
            This website contains anything that interests me. I am documenting my life mostly for myself and
            have no
            expectations that anyone ever even reads this. In the off chance that someone is, you can easily
            find my
            resume, updates on my marathon training, random videos and writings I make, along with some
            documentation and explanation of my journey with Christ.

            Why I Made This Website

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>I hate Linkedin, YouTube, and pretty much every other major website</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>I have a love hate relationship with technology and enjoy coding</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>It feels pretty cool having my own website</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>I like old simple websites like <a href="http://www.mileswmathis.com">mileswmathis.com</a></h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Proof that I somewhat know how to code and am pretty versatile</h4>

        </h4>
        <h3>How Do I Code So Beautifully?</h3>
        <h4>
            Guess I'm just gifted. Mozilla Development Network is how I taught myself to code this website. I knew the
            basics already and did have prior coding experience in Python and Java, so it wasn't too painful. If you
            want to view my code check out my Github here (insert link).
        </h4>
        <h3>My Future</h3>
        <h4>
            I have no clue what’ll come next, but I will be living in North Carolina until at least 2024. I will
            be
            running a marathon sometime in 2024 in memory of my friend Kostyantyn. Hope to get some friends in the area
            over the next few months.
